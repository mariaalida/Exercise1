Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------

### Concepts

What is the difference between *concurrency* and *parallelism*?
> concurrency is when dealing with multiple things/threads at the time (only dealing, not doing), while parallelism is  

What is the difference between a *race condition* and a *data race*? 
> Race condition is when the result depends on the order the code is run.  
 
*Very* roughly - what does a *scheduler* do, and how does it do it?
> A scheduler decides which threads to run at what time.  


### Engineering

Why would we use multiple threads? What kinds of problems do threads solve?
> *Your answer here*

Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they, and why would we rather use them over threads?
> fibers are threads divided into multiple tasks. 

Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?

What do you think is best - *shared variables* or *message passing*?
